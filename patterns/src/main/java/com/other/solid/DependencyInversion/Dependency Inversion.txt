Dependency Inversion Principle


It is used to create loosely coupled entities that are easy to test, modify and update.
This principle can be formulated as follows:
  - Top-level modules must not depend on lower-level modules. Both those and others should depend on abstractions.
  - Abstractions should not depend on the details. Details should depend on abstractions.
