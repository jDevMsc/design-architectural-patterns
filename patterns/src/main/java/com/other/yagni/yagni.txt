YAGNI – you ain’t gonna need it

The fact that you do not think in the system should not appear in the code.

DRY is designed to reduce complexity by dividing the system into manageable components,
  while YAGNI reduces complexity by reducing the number of these components.


YAGNI is like KISS - it tries to make things as simple as possible.
But KISS is trying to find simple solutions, and YAGNI just does not make any decisions!

When planning a new project, try to consider the following:
- Achieve less complexity by reducing the level of abstractions
- Separate functionality from features
- Take into account small non-functional requirements
- Identify time-consuming tasks to get rid of them
