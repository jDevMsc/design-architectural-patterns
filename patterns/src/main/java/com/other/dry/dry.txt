Don’t repeat yourself or DIE – Duplication Is Evil

It is aimed at reducing the repetition of information

Violation of DRY - WET — «Write Everything Twice» or «We enjoy typing»

Knowledge is part of a business logic or algorithm.
Duplication of knowledge is always a violation of the DRY principle.
Code duplication is not necessarily a violation of the DRY principle.


Exception - caveats: ========================

You should not apply DRY if the business logic does not yet contain any duplication, if you apply DRY to something,
that is used only once, you may find yourself in a situation of premature optimization.

If you start to abstract something, because “later it may be needed”, then do not do this.
We will spend time abstracting that which may then never be claimed.

Code reuse and code duplication are two different things.
DRY says that you don’t need to duplicate knowledge, and not that you always need to make the code reusable.
