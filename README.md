# Design and architectural patterns (updated...)
## Hi all, my name is Artem!  
Beautiful architecture and a user-friendly program, this is what I loved in programming. 
I’m not such a serious developer yet, but I’m already working hard to become one of them. 
I am sure that you, like me, did not immediately understand everything, but you have to work and one day we will make our Facebook)  

This repository explains the basic design patterns, namely GOF, Grasp, the principles of SOLID and others, such as DRY, KISS, etc.

## Structure  
* Patterns
    * [GOF](https://github.com/artemGM/design-architectural-patterns/tree/master/patterns/src/main/java/com/gof)  
    (basic design patterns of GOFs and their principles of use by examples)
    * [Other](https://github.com/artemGM/design-architectural-patterns/tree/master/patterns/src/main/java/com/other)  
    * [SOLID](https://github.com/artemGM/design-architectural-patterns/tree/master/patterns/src/main/java/com/other/solid)  
    (patterns for easy maintenance and expansion over time)
    

## What next   
At the moment, work is underway to update the section on applying patterns, I want to make examples related to real-world development. Also, comments are not always translated into English, I am working on it.

Stay tuned, this repository plans to be cool and interesting
